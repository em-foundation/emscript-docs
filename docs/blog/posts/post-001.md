# (Re-)Introducing EM&thinsp;!!

The journey continues....&thinsp; Back from the "drawing-board", we've now reworked the original [EM Programming Language](https://docs.emlang.openem.org/) into a novel  environment &ndash; _quantitatively_&thinsp; improving embedded code performance as well as _qualitatively_&thinsp; elevating your embedded coding experience.

## From EM to **EM&bull;Script**

We've followed a very simple recipe in our latest flagship effort:

{[bx,1]} &nbsp; start with **TypeScript** &ndash; a widely-used ("top-five") modern programming language;<br>
{[bx,2]} &nbsp; add **VS Code** to the mix &ndash; the popular IDE in fact written in TypeScript; and then<br>
{[bx,2]} &nbsp; fold in some "secret-sauce" found in **EM** &ndash; which finally takes us to **EM&bull;Script**

Operating within the confines of **TypeScript** &ndash; and leveraging its world-class language support within **VS Code** &ndash; we've morphed a standalone **EM** language (used by just a handful of developers since 2010) into an **EM&bull;Script** environment accessible to the broader community.

Following our inaugural  **EM&bull;Script SDK** release [{[sh]v26.1.0}], watch for revamped tutorials and articles coming available at this site &ndash; including updated **EM&bull;Mark** scores which measure program size, execution time, and overall energy efficiency of embedded applications.

But ultimately, you'll have to evaluate **EM&bull;Script** on your own terms &ndash; so let's get started&thinsp;!!


## Call to action
